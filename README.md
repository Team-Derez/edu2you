## Inspiration 
Bringing the ability to learn for anyone, regardless of disabilities

## What it does
Edu2You allows users to request help and volunteer to help bring school supplies, transportation, technology, and alternative teaching strategies.

## How we built it
We started by finding a template that allowed for a username and password on html, we then linked it to our code that we built from scratch to determine if the user is an admin, volunteer, or student.

## Challenges we ran into
- Authorizing and creating new users with listed information being properly stored into their correct positions.
- After logging in, changing the web page to the correct webpage based on the user's credentials.
- Creating checklists and to allow for certain values to be filled with sortable data based on a user's needs/specialties.
- Syntax (one computer's default spacing was using tab, while another was spacebar, which led to multiple syntax errors).
- Pulling values from checkboxes using html.
- Application security.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
-We successfully created a login and signup page that prompts the next page based on the user's credentials.
-Our overall progress as a team from identifying a problem and working through a solution. 

## What we learned
-How to form a team in 5 minutes.
-How to use code with little to no experience.
-How to debug both virtually and communicatively
-How design leads to implementation.

## What's next for EDU2You
- Security features
- Page design for each user website
- Object storage (databases)
